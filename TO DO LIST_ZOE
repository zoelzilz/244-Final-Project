TAB 2 TASKS

3. Copy and paste the annual map code for all 12 months and pull in the shapefiles for those months -- will do once the equation is input correctly
4. Save those .png files with tmap_save into the www/ folder in the app directory folder -- same as 3
4b. Zoe can do this if you don't want to... but ... update server.R with filenames for pngs i.e.:
else if(input$Month == "January"){
      img(height = 500, width = 300, src = "jan.png")
      
      (you'll see this in the server code, it's pretty obvious)
      
AND THEN TAB 2 IS DONE

ideas:

map has three layers
1) clickable polygons with loss by month output
2) historical kelp beds
3) actual kelp biomass

to do tomorrow:

(1)rbind everything together in the data vis 
- run top chunk with data
- skip raster 1 and 2
- run third chunk with mutations and name changing and rbinding
-separate chunks, run only the last intersect

(1b) SAVE into new spatial polygons dataset using writeOGR

(2) finish making all the heatmaps now that the extents are correct
- save them to /www folder

(3) plug new HUGE rbinded spatial polygon dataset into app and see if it runs without burning to the ground
- just replace ogr_annual_intersect2 and MAKE SURE to replace all instances of ssh with "kelploss" or whatever we name it

(4) get Tom's kelp data and play with it

(5) add layer with kelp beds (from separate dataset that we already have somewehre)

(6) make it all pretty
