###What is the app?
This shiny application was created to visualize Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) biomass percent loss in southern California. 

This app allows users to interatively explore annual and monthly kelp average biomass loss and average kelp biomass in historic leasable kelp harvest beds as well as visualize heatmaps of annual and monthly expected kelp biomass loss.   

Giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) biomass percent loss has been non-linearly related (Cavanaugh 2011) to significant wave height using data from  winter storms in the Santa Barbara Channel.

###How do I use it?
