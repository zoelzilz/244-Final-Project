This map shows *Macrocystis pyrifera* beds in Southern California. Use the buttons in the bottom left to toggle between the following:

1. Visualize of current kelp biomass in each historical kelp bed.

2. Interactive visualization of kelp biomass loss due to wave activity throughout the year. 

3. Persistence of kelp beds, calculated by taking proportion of years (1984 - 2018) where kelp canopy was observed in a 1 kilometer cell (as a fraction of the total area of the kelp in that cell).


You can also choose to show or hide the historical kelp harvest beds.
