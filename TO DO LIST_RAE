TO DO LIST FOR RAE:

tomorrow:
1. Fix raster crop in allthemaps.R (not in datavis markdown) to better represent SoCal --DONE
2. Incorporate kelp loss equation (again, in allthemaps.R) --DONE

---- zoe will do 3-5 ----
      
5. Figure out if we need to use qgis to extract the sig wave height data to make the bar graphs on tab 1 (kelp loss by month for a certain *clickable* harvest bed) OR if we can just use the shapefile to make these graphs (idk how but we can figure it out) -- I believe we can convert the shapefile to a dataframe and then plot normally. adding documentation now to googledoc and researching

6. Same re: the final tab
7. Get hands on the equation to calculate economic losses -- potentially change this to widget of info on values for each kelp product 
8. Get shapefile for harvest beds and mess with overlaying it over // binding it to our og shapefile -- shapefile added
