TO DO LIST FOR RAE:

tomorrow:
1. Fix raster crop in allthemaps.R (not in datavis markdown) to better represent SoCal --DONE
2. Incorporate kelp loss equation (again, in allthemaps.R) --equation there, code not finished with project since it seems you know how but if you don't I can figure it out
3. Copy and paste the annual map code for all 12 months and pull in the shapefiles for those months -- will do once the equation is input correctly
4. Save those .png files with tmap_save into the www/ folder in the app directory folder -- same as 3
4b. Zoe can do this if you don't want to... but ... update server.R with filenames for pngs i.e.:
else if(input$Month == "January"){
      img(height = 500, width = 300, src = "jan.png")
      
      (you'll see this in the server code, it's pretty obvious)
      
5. Figure out if we need to use qgis to extract the sig wave height data to make the bar graphs on tab 1 (kelp loss by month for a certain *clickable* harvest bed) OR if we can just use the shapefile to make these graphs (idk how but we can figure it out) -- I believe we can convert the shapefile to a dataframe and then plot normally. adding documentation now to googledoc and researching

6. Same re: the final tab
7. Get hands on the equation to calculate economic losses -- potentially change this to widget of info on values for each kelp product 
8. Get shapefile for harvest beds and mess with overlaying it over // binding it to our og shapefile -- shapefile added
