FUTURE TO DO:
-- better SWH function (more constrained), work with Tom
-- contact NREL re: duplicates, see if there has been a list generated or troubleshoot ourselves
-- get graph output either to hide when toggling off the percent biomass layer OR put the outputs in the same graph box rather than just over the area which actually might clarify things a lot 
- change order of tabs so rasters show first

FINAL FIXES: 
-- image isn't showing on mine, also make kelp image longer to fill space now longer with data section? or size is actually kinda good --DONE
--mother fucker fix the legends on the rasters... need to say percent and currently only annual does? OR put in subtitle maybe also change basemap to darker blue --DONE
-- can the graph "hide" when the kelp percent biomass loss isn't toggled on? it takes up a lot of the screen OR at least change the order of layers so that kelp percent biomass loss is on first --DONE
--fix sidebar on map, still covering toggle --DONE (moved content to the intro tab)
-- add "average" to swh when hovering over polygons --DONE
-- fix grammar/explanation in kelp harvester bed explorer --DONE
-- sort of unclear need to zoom in to actually see kelp persistence changes? -- brennie said intuitive
-- explain why the circles change size --DONE
-- change "month"" to "heatmaps" from radio buttons title -- DONE
-- change color of title on tab 3, change to md? --no, I actually like it white. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT ARE DONE:
- all raster map pngs are created (and rae fixed them) and in /www folder
- abline added to line graph
- googled polygonID / deleted polygons issue. not sure it is fixable

- fix ggplot legend # done
- finalize color of dots #done
- make dots say something other than "hello!" when clicked # done

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE

- third tab with reactive financial loss input/output

- ## done ### change legend size, title size (or existence?) on the raster map pngs -- will involve re-running 13 simple scripts and overwriting 13 png files. **not too labor intensive but also not a priority**

- ## no ## figure out how to map the rasters within our existing leaflet -- would be VERY CLEAN and awesome looking but **probably labor intensive and not worth it** plus would take away from one tab

- switch to using plotly (interactive) instead of ggplot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE

- finalize look and feel of app // make it pretty 
  - padding on the panels or maybe just use html to format these
  - make colors/font/shape of layout and tabs nice feeling
  - look at some cool apps on gallery and emulate their layouts
- write and format intro tab
  - still need to add in a chunk of information about all three of our data sources (both spatialpolygondatasets and the csv from tom)

----------------------- done things >> --------------------

- REORDER KELP_INTERSECTED@DATA$MONTHS FACTOR SO ITS IN A NORMAL MFCKING ORDER #done

- change bar graph to line graph/frequency polygon? (this is proving to be more difficult than i originally thought) #done

- figure out and execute: adding historic kelp bed layer onto map #done
- figure out how to toggle between layers #done
- wrangle kelp biomass data and add clickable variable sized dots layer to leaflet basemap #done

OTHER PROGRESS NOTES











** ignore below **
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TAB 2 TASKS

3. Copy and paste the annual map code for all 12 months and pull in the shapefiles for those months -- will do once the equation is input correctly
4. Save those .png files with tmap_save into the www/ folder in the app directory folder -- same as 3
4b. Zoe can do this if you don't want to... but ... update server.R with filenames for pngs i.e.:
else if(input$Month == "January"){
      img(height = 500, width = 300, src = "jan.png")
      
      (you'll see this in the server code, it's pretty obvious)
      
AND THEN TAB 2 IS DONE

ideas:

map has three layers
1) clickable polygons with loss by month output
2) historical kelp beds
3) actual kelp biomass

to do tomorrow:

(1)rbind everything together in the data vis 
- run top chunk with data
- skip raster 1 and 2
- run third chunk with mutations and name changing and rbinding
-separate chunks, run only the last intersect

(1b) SAVE into new spatial polygons dataset using writeOGR

(2) finish making all the heatmaps now that the extents are correct
- save them to /www folder

(3) plug new HUGE rbinded spatial polygon dataset into app and see if it runs without burning to the ground
- just replace ogr_annual_intersect2 and MAKE SURE to replace all instances of ssh with "kelploss" or whatever we name it

(4) get Tom's kelp data and play with it

(5) add layer with kelp beds (from separate dataset that we already have somewehre)

(6) make it all pretty

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TO DO LIST FOR RAE:

tomorrow:
1. Fix raster crop in allthemaps.R (not in datavis markdown) to better represent SoCal --DONE
2. Incorporate kelp loss equation (again, in allthemaps.R) --DONE

---- zoe will do 3-5 ----
      
5. Figure out if we need to use qgis to extract the sig wave height data to make the bar graphs on tab 1 (kelp loss by month for a certain *clickable* harvest bed) OR if we can just use the shapefile to make these graphs (idk how but we can figure it out) -- I believe we can convert the shapefile to a dataframe and then plot normally. adding documentation now to googledoc and researching

6. Same re: the final tab
7. Get hands on the equation to calculate economic losses -- potentially change this to widget of info on values for each kelp product 
8. Get shapefile for harvest beds and mess with overlaying it over // binding it to our og shapefile -- shapefile added
