--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT ARE DONE:
- all raster map pngs are created (and rae fixed them) and in /www folder
- abline added to line graph
- googled polygonID / deleted polygons issue. not sure it is fixable

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE

- third tab with reactive financial loss input/output

- ## done ### change legend size, title size (or existence?) on the raster map pngs -- will involve re-running 13 simple scripts and overwriting 13 png files. **not too labor intensive but also not a priority**

- ## no ## figure out how to map the rasters within our existing leaflet -- would be VERY CLEAN and awesome looking but **probably labor intensive and not worth it** plus would take away from one tab

- switch to using plotly (interactive) instead of ggplot

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE

- fix ggplot legend
- finalize color of dots
- make dots say something other than "hello!" when clicked

- finalize look and feel of app // make it pretty 
  - padding on the panels or maybe just use html to format these
  - make colors/font/shape of layout and tabs nice feeling
  - look at some cool apps on gallery and emulate their layouts
- write and format intro tab

----------------------- done things >> --------------------

- REORDER KELP_INTERSECTED@DATA$MONTHS FACTOR SO ITS IN A NORMAL MFCKING ORDER #done

- change bar graph to line graph/frequency polygon? (this is proving to be more difficult than i originally thought) #done

- figure out and execute: adding historic kelp bed layer onto map #done
- figure out how to toggle between layers #done
- wrangle kelp biomass data and add clickable variable sized dots layer to leaflet basemap #done



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER PROGRESS NOTES

- everything currently made is combined together as of 10:45 am 3/9
- app is currently crashing because it cannot load data ONLY IN THE FULL APP - mini (testing_clickable_map) is working fine
- for some reason adding layerID = ~polygonID instead of ~unique(polygonID) deletes several polygons
- months are in the wrong order
-coercing ggplot to geom_line is not working, consider switching to plotly

TAB 2 TASKS

3. Copy and paste the annual map code for all 12 months and pull in the shapefiles for those months -- will do once the equation is input correctly
4. Save those .png files with tmap_save into the www/ folder in the app directory folder -- same as 3
4b. Zoe can do this if you don't want to... but ... update server.R with filenames for pngs i.e.:
else if(input$Month == "January"){
      img(height = 500, width = 300, src = "jan.png")
      
      (you'll see this in the server code, it's pretty obvious)
      
AND THEN TAB 2 IS DONE

ideas:

map has three layers
1) clickable polygons with loss by month output
2) historical kelp beds
3) actual kelp biomass

to do tomorrow:

(1)rbind everything together in the data vis 
- run top chunk with data
- skip raster 1 and 2
- run third chunk with mutations and name changing and rbinding
-separate chunks, run only the last intersect

(1b) SAVE into new spatial polygons dataset using writeOGR

(2) finish making all the heatmaps now that the extents are correct
- save them to /www folder

(3) plug new HUGE rbinded spatial polygon dataset into app and see if it runs without burning to the ground
- just replace ogr_annual_intersect2 and MAKE SURE to replace all instances of ssh with "kelploss" or whatever we name it

(4) get Tom's kelp data and play with it

(5) add layer with kelp beds (from separate dataset that we already have somewehre)

(6) make it all pretty

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TO DO LIST FOR RAE:

tomorrow:
1. Fix raster crop in allthemaps.R (not in datavis markdown) to better represent SoCal --DONE
2. Incorporate kelp loss equation (again, in allthemaps.R) --DONE

---- zoe will do 3-5 ----
      
5. Figure out if we need to use qgis to extract the sig wave height data to make the bar graphs on tab 1 (kelp loss by month for a certain *clickable* harvest bed) OR if we can just use the shapefile to make these graphs (idk how but we can figure it out) -- I believe we can convert the shapefile to a dataframe and then plot normally. adding documentation now to googledoc and researching

6. Same re: the final tab
7. Get hands on the equation to calculate economic losses -- potentially change this to widget of info on values for each kelp product 
8. Get shapefile for harvest beds and mess with overlaying it over // binding it to our og shapefile -- shapefile added
